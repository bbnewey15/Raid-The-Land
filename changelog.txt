5/4 - Split data resource so that board data was separate from slot data. Slot data now is 1 array for player slots and 1 array for enemy slots so its easier to loop through
5/4 - Add Fight to Column Group to loop through; Next: Add attack signals to slot and Add an animation?
5/5 - Add Attack signals to slots and connect to UnitColumns
5/12 - Added animations to fight; Next: Add visible health bars and other stats to units
5/12 - Added health bar/ health / dmg to unit_data -- also used unit_data as template; ToDo - add moving units in post
5/12 - Added basic movement from column to column
5/15 - Changed background image

TODO: add_slot by unit_data instead of by slot data -- or handle the data better?

TODO:
EZ:
****Make Units Die on 0
****Update health bar to match max health instead of 100
****Fix movement ui - probably just move the UI to the bottom of the screen
Add defense mode to unit ( counter attack = if a unit blocks damage, add a percentage of that dmg to the next attack )
Add draw cards stage - for now just randomly pick 3 cards and add to hand
Add simple ai

Big Features:
Create encounter upgrade cards ( round modifiers, phase modifiers (multiple rounds), encounter modifiers(multi phases) ) 
   Infantry gain +10 block, infantry gain +30% counter attack percentage), etc
Create Unit item cards
   Unit holding item gains leadership that boosts nearby units, get this card back on death, unit gains overshield if doesnt attack
Create a level up for each unit based on experience

AI:
Keep track of stats to use for AI
 Number of units, Number of each type of unit, Location of frontline
Add simple ai for placing new units on next place stage
Add simple ai drawing new cards
AI for determining attack order
AI for moving up unit

Possible Ideas:
BIG CHANGE - units do not attack full rows - must choose attack/def/supp and select target
Only allow for units to be placed 1 column away from frontline
Have 3 different actions -- Attack/Defend/Heal
Before encounter, draft your army
 = Pick a unit and adjust their stats (attack,defence,support)
   = Based on the level - add up to 5 pts
     = if attack = 3, defence = 2, support = 1 | 
Each run has a # of reinforcements. Lose all your reinforcements in battle, then game over
Unit Level ups carry over to next round?

Brainstorm:
Micro round thoughts:
What are the unknowns when starting a fight?
 -Will my unit die before he acts?
 -Will the enemy attack/defend/heal?
 -Will the enemy place a game modifier for this round?

Encounter Big Picture thoughts:
 -Will win this round? Should I tank this round to try to win 2/3
 -Early Game Strat
   - Try to win the first round
 -Late Game Strat
   - Level up unit
 -Should I retreat to save men?
