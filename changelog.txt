5/4 - Split data resource so that board data was separate from slot data. Slot data now is 1 array for player slots and 1 array for enemy slots so its easier to loop through
5/4 - Add Fight to Column Group to loop through; Next: Add attack signals to slot and Add an animation?
5/5 - Add Attack signals to slots and connect to UnitColumns
5/12 - Added animations to fight; Next: Add visible health bars and other stats to units
5/12 - Added health bar/ health / dmg to unit_data -- also used unit_data as template; ToDo - add moving units in post
5/12 - Added basic movement from column to column
5/15 - Changed background image
****Make Units Die on 0
****Update health bar to match max health instead of 100
****Fix movement ui - probably just move the UI to the bottom of the screen
units do not attack full rows - must choose attack/def/supp and select target
Add defense mode to unit ( counter attack = if a unit blocks damage, add a percentage of that dmg to the next attack )
**DONE* Limit columns to 2 v 1 ( + reinforcements )
**DONE remove cards

Adjustments to new game:
 Bring 3 units in on 2 columns 
   - 1 column is active and 1 is passive
     - a column can have 0 to 3 units in it
     - this allows squishies to be safer while not totally immune and will be able to risk for bigger dmg
 New identity of game is active + passive cohesion with actions/skill trees
 Unit types:
   Soldier, Archer, Tank, Rogue, Shaman
 This gives the option to make each unit a certain archetype via skill trees
 Enemies have a certain number of reinforcements per stage with warning of who is coming
 Actions cost AP
  - Moving back/foward costs 1 AP
  - Strong actions take more AP
  - Regular actions take less
DND style for rolls to see damage / armor value
3 characters available at a time
 - if 1 dies, you start over with lvl 1 character
